### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain LIBR's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible LIBR
- Enable a sustainable system for LIBR's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Follow all instructions in [the template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)**
2. **Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)**
3. **After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing**

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üöÄ `:rocket:` when deploying stuff
    * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    * üëï `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### Changelog Management

We maintain a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format. 

#### For Contributors:
- **DO NOT** directly edit the changelog
- Use conventional commit messages that can be automatically parsed
- Your changes will be automatically added to the changelog during release

#### Conventional Commit Format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- `fix`: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(core): add DHT node discovery mechanism
fix(web-client): resolve connection timeout issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
perf(core): optimize message validation algorithm
```

#### Breaking Changes:
For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope:
```bash
feat(core)!: redesign moderation quorum API
```

Or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:
```bash
feat(core): redesign moderation quorum API

BREAKING CHANGE: The moderationQuorum.validate() method now requires
an additional parameter for consensus threshold.
```

#### Commit Message Validation

We provide a script to validate your commit messages locally:

```bash
# Validate a commit message
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "feat(core): add DHT node discovery mechanism"

# Example of invalid message
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "added new feature"  # ‚ùå Will fail

# Example of valid messages
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "feat(core): add DHT node discovery"     # ‚úÖ Valid
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "fix(web-client): resolve timeout"       # ‚úÖ Valid
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "docs: update installation guide"        # ‚úÖ Valid
```

This helps ensure your commits will be properly included in the automated changelog generation.

## Additional Notes

### Release Process

LIBR follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and automated changelog generation:

1. **Automated Changelog**: The changelog is automatically updated during releases based on conventional commit messages
2. **Version Bumping**: Versions are determined automatically:
   - `fix:` commits trigger PATCH releases (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1)
   - `feat:` commits trigger MINOR releases (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` triggers MAJOR releases (0.1.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0)
3. **Release Notes**: Generated automatically from commit messages and PR descriptions

### Maintainer Responsibilities

For maintainers creating releases:
1. Ensure all PRs use conventional commit messages
2. Review and merge PRs following the pull request guidelines
3. Create releases through GitHub's release interface
4. The changelog will be automatically updated with properly categorized changes

**üìö For detailed maintainer guidance:** See [docs/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md](docs/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md) for best practices on working with new contributors.
